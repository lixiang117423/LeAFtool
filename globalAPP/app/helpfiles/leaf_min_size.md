## Minimum leaf size

***

This is the minimum number of pixels (that is, the size) of a leaf that the program should consider.

So if one of your leaves has a number of pixels smaller than the specified minimum number of pixels, it will not be taken into account in the analysis.
For example, at the end of the analysis, the program can count more leaves than there are because, for example, some of the elements present in the background have been interpreted as a leaf. Thus, to impose a minimum size of leaf a little higher makes it possible to obtain the good number of leaves.
